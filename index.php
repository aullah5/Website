        <div class="col"><b>Professional and Personal Details:</b>
            I am a student at George Mason University majoring in IT and Concentrating in Database Technology and Programming. I currently work at a small internet registry software company in Herndon Virginia. I have experience in a variety of programming languages including Java, Python and C. I have also worked in web development with frameworks like Bootstrap and ReactJS.
            <br />
            After graduating from George Mason, I plan on going straight into the IT workforce. I have always enjoyed learning new skills and have taught himself how to play instruments like the Piano and Ukulele. Being able to have self-motivation to pursue projects is something that I take pride in.
            <br />
            Working in the field of Information Technology has been a goal for me since I was younger. I enjoy starting and leading my own projects, however I also know that experience is the most important asset anyone in IT can have. My plan is to work for a top tier corporation and instill in myself a workforce mindset. Furthermore, I intend to take the lead on projects and eventually work my way into a managerial position. I plan on being a highly ethical worker, ensuring that any and all employees are treated with respect, while also being able to complete projects in a timely manner. Finally, my long-term goal is to start a company of my own, using all of the skills I learned throughout school and work.
            Other than school and work, I am a religious minded individual who enjoys going outside, working out, and having fun.</div>
